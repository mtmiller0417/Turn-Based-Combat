## Skills  
    [Update?]
    Skills are related from the major stats, like in DND. However they can be trained and raised seperately somehow. 
    
    Or no major stats to govern bc that benefits dnd bc theres less to keep track of since its not a 'video' game and there is just skills that can be leveled up, like Skyrim.(like this)  

<table>
<tr> <th>Skill</th> <th>Governing Attr</th> <th>Description</th> </tr>
<tr><td>One-handed</td> <td>STR / DEX</td> <td>tbd</td></tr>
<tr><td>Two-handed</td> <td>STR / DEX</td> <td>tbd</td></tr>
<tr><td>Archery</td> <td>DEX</td> <td>tbd</td></tr>
<tr><td>Blocking</td> <td>STR / CON</td> <td>tbd</td></tr>

# World
    --- BACKGROUND ---
    
    Your character is living in a small town.< How'd they get there? >. Recently nearby, there have been strange reports on attacks by all kinds of creatures. It has caused the roads to become more dangerous and supplies influx has slowed. Something must be causing this, but first you must secure survival for yourself and your town.

    Things are not too dire yet, but they are only getting worse and the Lord does not help. Perhaps there is a way to make him see...

    There are all kinds of shops in the town. 
    
    Earn money by completing various quests found on the board in the town square and by speaking to people in town. You can also sell goods you might collect in town as well.
